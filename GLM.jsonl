{"label": "\n Gregorian calendar reform advocates have long argued for the need to update and improve the current system. These advocates believe that the current calendar, which was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, is outdated and does not accurately reflect the natural cycles of the Earth. They argue that a reform is necessary to address the discrepancies and make the calendar more efficient and accurate.\n\nOne of the main arguments put forth by Gregorian calendar reform advocates is that the current system does not accurately account for the length of a solar year. The current calendar assumes that a year is exactly 365.25 days long, which is why we have a leap year every four years. However, this approximation is not entirely accurate, as a solar year is actually about 365.2425 days long. This discrepancy may seem small, but over time it can add up and lead to a misalignment between the calendar and the natural seasons.\n\nAnother issue raised by Gregorian calendar reform advocates is the uneven distribution of days across the months. Currently, some months have 30 days, while others have 31, and February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year. This irregularity can make it difficult to plan and schedule events, as the number of days in a month can vary from year to year. Advocates propose a more uniform distribution of days, with each month having the same number of days, making it easier to plan and organize.\n\nFurthermore, Gregorian calendar reform advocates argue that the current calendar's religious origins and biases should be addressed. The Gregorian calendar was introduced by the Catholic Church, and its structure reflects the Christian religious beliefs and traditions. Advocates argue that a secular calendar,", "predict": "depending on whether it is a leap year or not. This creates a problem for people who need to plan their schedules around specific dates, as the number of days in a month can vary greatly.\n\nGregorian calendar reform advocates argue that a reform of the calendar is necessary to address these discrepancies and make the calendar more efficient and accurate. They propose a new calendar system that accounts for the length of a solar year and distributes days evenly across the months. This system would eliminate the need for leap years and the uneven distribution of days across the months, and would make the calendar more in line with the natural seasons. 首先"}
