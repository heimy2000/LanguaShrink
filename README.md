# LanguaShrink
Currently, we are conducting experiments in sequence, including the test code which is all contained within this document. We have removed the full version of LanguaShrink from the code and only retained the steps necessary to call GPT using the core components of LanguaShrink, as the LanguaShrink model has not yet completed security testing and other tests. We plan to release an API version of LanguaShrink that has passed security testing by the end of the year.
In the novel test, we only used the core components to call the LanguaShrink model for experiments. The complete code is within the compressed file named "xiaoshuo".
We have already planned to open-source all data, models, and core code upon completion of this research. At present, due to the need for further organization and ensuring the privacy and security of the data, as well as improving the documentation for the code and model, we are actively preparing for the relevant work.
